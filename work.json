The overview mode displays our solar system and what it looks like today from a bird's eye view, according to NASA's calculations. The slider can be used to make the planets travel back and forth in time. Then there’s the exploration mode, which allows the user to travel through space at superluminal velocities and learn more about the major bodies in our solar system.<br><br>Planetary data is fetched from <a href='http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi' target='_blank'>NASA Horizons Web API</a> and the scroll animations are made possible with the brilliance of <a href='http://scrollmagic.io/' target='_blank'>ScrollMagic</a> and <a href='https://greensock.com/tweenmax' target='_blank'>TweenMax</a>.",

It started as a small project for a course at Uppsala University, but we found the concept very appealing and wanted to see how far we could take it. Thus, wauv was born.<br><br>We’re developing wauv around the concepts of flexibility and scalability; to be able to implement new visualization ideas without rewriting the whole shebang. This is made possible by the use of object-oriented JavaScript and some brilliant libraries such as <a href='https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael' target='_blank'>Raphaël.js</a>. The audio is streamed through <a href='https://soundcloud.com/' target='_blank'>SoundCloud</a>, and I’m forever grateful for their awesome API and audio service!<br><br>Want to contribute and try making your own visualization?

It’s made from scratch using the MVC framework FuelPHP to fit the exact needs of the customer. Administrators can manage users, activties, newsletters, file uploads, slideshows, questionnaires and content on all web pages. The system also allows other non-profit organisations to create profiles and add activities of their own, which can then be viewed by visitors at the site.

We also came up with a reward system and an exercise mode that would emulate running on real terrain on a treadmill by using geological data from the Google Maps API.<br><br>Although the app was never developed I took the time to create some graphical content and a mockup of what it could’ve looked like.
